Selenium tests for CTools

## Matrix of Issues versus Test Cases failing
We have a Google Spreadsheet, where we add additional notes of the test cases that fails and the bug related and also the Pentaho version that occurs.
So, when CI fails the automation tests, we should go to this sheet and check if there is a bug already open to that test case, otherwise we should investigate and open an issue if required and then update the sheet.
